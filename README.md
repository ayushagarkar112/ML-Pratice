# Machine Learning Practice Repository

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is structured as a **personal learning and practice space** to study **Machine Learning from basics to mastery**.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Build a **strong foundation** in Machine Learning concepts
- Implement algorithms **from scratch to applied use**
- Practice ML step-by-step using **Python and Scikit-Learn**
- Maintain clean, well-organized, and reproducible notebooks
- Track learning progress over time

This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a production project.
